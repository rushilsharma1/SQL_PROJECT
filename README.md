"Exciting Project Update!

I'm thrilled to share my latest project with you all! I recently worked on a Pizza Sales Analysis using SQL, where I dived into the world of data to uncover insights that can inform business decisions.

Project Overview: I analyzed a dataset of pizza sales to identify trends, patterns, and correlations that can help optimize sales strategies. Using SQL, I extracted, transformed, and loaded the data to create a comprehensive dashboard that highlights key performance indicators.

Key Findings:

1.most ordered pizza types along with their quantities
2.Join the necessary tables to find the total quantity of each pizza category ordered.
3.Join relevant tables to find the category-wise distribution of pizzas.
4.Group the orders by date and calculate the average number of pizzas ordered per day.
Skills Used:

Data analysis and visualization
SQL programming
Data modeling and database design
Takeaways: This project not only honed my SQL skills but also gave me a deeper understanding of how data analysis can drive business growth. I'm excited to apply these skills to future projects and help organizations make data-driven decisions.
